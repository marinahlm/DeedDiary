1.1 INTRODUCTION

The journalling trend is rising with the increase of the usage of terms such as studyblr, studygram or bujo (bullet journal). However, it is already a norm for most of the millennial generation to write their thoughts down either for the use of keeping track of their schedules, or to expand their ideas on their devices instead of books. We believe that the development of a diary application software is go-to for young adults to better themselves. Hence, the name “Deed Diary”. The variety of functions in an application will be the main delivery of this Deed Diary, especially to keep track of the good and bad things one has done for a whole day, month, year, etc.  

1.2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

1.2.2 Problem Statement 
Currently there is lack of product that would help users to track the details of their deeds, on the same time take notes of other pertinent issues related to their daily activities, which serves like a diary. The development of the mobile Deed Diary application helps Muslims who are having difficulties in tracking their deeds and it also ease them to sort out their daily activities systematically.

1.7 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT 
Better reflection
The daily diary entry help Muslims reflect on their schedule of daily activities. Reflecting the deeds with the statistics can make everything seem much clearer on what good or bad have the user done. 
Healthy spiritual and physical
Muslims can improve their productive life spiritually and physically. Even they are busy with tasks and assignments especially for students, they always find time for doing Ibadah.

1.8 SUMMARY 
All in all, the mobile application which we are going to develop will ease anyone who wants to track their good and bad deeds and also daily activities. As Muslims should practice amar ma’ruf nahi munkar, they can use this mobile application to reconcile themselves.
